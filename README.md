Real-Time Performance & Resource Monitoring System for Linux-based Devices (RPRMS)

The script is very efficient, easily modifiable, and requires little pre-requisites (Python 3.x+ and ‘psutils’ library),Most shortcomings mentioned can be addressed given a little bit of time and I'm always working on ways to improve it! There’s a lot of metrics that can be added here according to the tester’s needs, for example if we want the temperature of every individual CPU core to check multithreading efficiency, it can be done very easily.
